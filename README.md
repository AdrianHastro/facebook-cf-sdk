Welcome to the **Facebook ColdFusion SDK** Wiki documentation.
=============================================================

# Introduction

The [[Facebook Platform|http://developers.facebook.com/]] is a set of APIs that make your application more social. Read more about [[integrating Facebook with your web site|http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web]] on the Facebook developer site. 

This project contains the open source **Facebook ColdFusion SDK** that allows you to integrate the [[Facebook Platform|http://developers.facebook.com/]] on your website powered by a [[ColdFusion application server|http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion]].

Facebook ColdFusion SDK provides 3 components :

* **FacebookApp.cfc** - A library to build iFrame/FBML [[apps on Facebook.com|http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/]] and [[websites with the Facebook Platform|http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web]] (the library is a complete port to ColdFusion of the [[Facebook PHP SDK V2.1.1|http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk]]).
* **FacebookGraphAPI.cfc** - A client wrapper to call Facebook Graph API (the wrapper is inspired from the latest official .NET and Python SDKs graph clients).
* **FacebookRestAPI.cfc** - A client wrapper to call the old Facebook Rest API.
